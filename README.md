# Henge 2 (now in Laravel)

## Basic Layout

Copied basic layout from Henge Egg. Use Alpine via Livewire to implement the interactivity needed by the Tailwindcss nav components.

## Next Steps

* Implement static Sarsens for guest access
* Move login/out to nav and pull right (see tw example original)
* Maybe nav menu needs to be injected from other views
* Implement login with Microsoft
* Year group links (maybe at the top?) could go to Henge pebbles
